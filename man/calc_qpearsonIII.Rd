\title{Quantile of Pearson Type III distribution}
\usage{
calc_qpearsonIII(p, mean = 0, sd = 1, skew = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{Vector of non-exceedance probabilities, between 0 and 1, to calculate quantiles.}

\item{mean}{Vector of means of the distribution of the data.}

\item{sd}{Vector of standard deviation of the distribution of the data.}

\item{skew}{Vector of skewness of the distribution of the data.}
}
\value{
Quantiles for the described distribution
}
\description{
Quantile of Pearson Type III distribution
}
\details{
\code{\link{calc_qpearsonIII}} and \code{\link{calc_qlpearsonIII}} are functions to fit a log-Pearson type III
distribution from a given mean, standard deviation, and skew. This source code is replicated,
unchanged, from the \code{swmrBase} package in order to reduce the dependency on that package.
